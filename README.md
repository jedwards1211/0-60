This is my script for creating an npm package from a skeleton project and
setting up the CI build as fast as possible. Once you've used this you'll never
want to go back to setting up all of that stuff manually.

# Installation

```sh
yarn global add 0-60
```

Or if you want you can run it with `npx`:

```sh
npx 0-60
```

# CLI

## Cloning a skeleton repository

```
0-60 clone <REPO URL>[#<BRANCH>]
```

`0-60` will prompt you for the new package name, organization, etc:

```
$ 0-60 clone https://github.com/jedwards1211/es2015-library-skeleton.git

## Pick from preset list of skeleton repos

You don't have to type the repository URL every time. Instead you can configure
a preset list of repositories to pick from by adding them to `~/.0-60.json`.
Then just run `0-60` without arguments, and outside of a repo directory.
`0-60` will prompt you to select which skeleton you want from this list.

Example `~/.0-60.json`:

```json
{
  "skeletons": [
    "jedwards1211/es2015-library-skeleton",
    "jedwards1211/react-library-skeleton",
    "jedwards1211/react-karma-library-skeleton",
    "jedwards1211/untranspiled-js-library-skeleton",
    "jedwards1211/typescript-library-skeleton",
    "jedwards1211/typescript-library-skeleton#pnpm"
  ]
}
```

```
$ 0-60
? Skeleton repo: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ jedwards1211/es2015-library-skeleton
  jedwards1211/react-library-skeleton
  jedwards1211/react-karma-library-skeleton
  jedwards1211/untranspiled-js-library-skeleton
  jedwards1211/typescript-library-skeleton
  jedwards1211/typescript-library-skeleton#pnpm
```

## Preparing for CI build

Running `0-60` inside in your repo directory will:

- Create the repository on GitHub
- enable Travis CI (if `.travis.yml` is present)

## Bringing in changes to the skeleton

Just run `git pull skeleton master` (`0-60` keeps the skeleton repository URL in the `skeleton` remote).
I recommend using the CLI in my fork of [merge-package.json](https://github.com/jedwards1211/merge-package.json) to automatically fix merge conflicts in `package.json`. (Install with `npm i -g jedwards1211/merge-package.json#cli` and then just run `merge-package.json` in the project directory after pulling.)
